# What OMH solves

OpenModelHub (OMH) is a lightweight and open-source desktop application to manage, download, and chat with models, either locally or in the cloud.

OMH utilizes ollama as its main model searching API. Users can add their own model API using an API link and key. OMH solves the problem of non-tech-savvy users not having a easy-to-use UI to manage and interact with their downloaded models locally.
